  # Some part of this waiting work is done by helm as of `--wait` with
  # `--timeout`. Note that the below in itself would not be sufficient: in case
  # of an upgrade we need to isolate the _new_ pods and not accidentally observe
  # the currently disappearing pods. Also note that despite the `--wait` above,
  # the kubelet plugins may still be in `PodInitializing` or `Init:0/1` after
  # the Helm command returned. My conclusion is that helm waits for the
  # controller to be READY, but not for the plugin pods to be READY. An old
  # plugin pod may also still be present in `Completed` state. The label
  # selector below may (rarely) pick it up, and of course that one will never
  # transition to READY. Fix that by only waiting for pods that are not in
  # Terminating/Completed state (that do not have a deletionTimestamp). That's
  # not natively supported by `kubectl wait`, hence this must be something of
  # the shape
  # `kubectl get pods ... | xargs -I{} kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/{} `
