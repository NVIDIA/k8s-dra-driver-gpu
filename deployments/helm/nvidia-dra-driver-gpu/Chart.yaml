apiVersion: v2
name: nvidia-dra-driver-gpu
description: Official Helm chart for the NVIDIA DRA Driver for GPUs
type: application

# Note(JP): strict semver: no v prefix allowed
version: "25.8.0-dev"

# Note(JP): templating logic consumes `appVersion` for building the default
# `tag` value used in a k8s image specification. That logic expects the version
# number below to not have a "v" prefix (a "v" is added by said logic to yield a
# valid image reference).
appVersion: "25.8.0-dev"

# The kubeVersion puts constraints on the Kubernetes versions where this helm
# chart can be installed. Note a '-0' at the end of a version string in the
# kubeVersion generally indicates that all pre-release versions should also be
# included. However, it is also required to allow a given chart to be installed
# on GKE as they add a '-gke-*' suffix to all of their Kubernetes versions.
kubeVersion: ">=1.32.0-0"
