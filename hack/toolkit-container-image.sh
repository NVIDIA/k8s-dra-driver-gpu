# Currently, this is hard-coded to the sha corresponding to the 1.18.0-rc.1 release
# of the nvidia-container-toolkit. In the future, we should determine the exact
# commit SHA corresponding to the version of the go module for the dependency
# on `github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit` -â€” whether it is a
# tagged release or a pseudo-version -- and return that SHA instead.
